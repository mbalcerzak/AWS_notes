Knowledge of:
- Architectural patterns (for example, event-driven, microservices, monolithic,
choreography, orchestration, fanout)
- Idempotency
- Differences between stateful and stateless concepts
- Differences between tightly coupled and loosely coupled components
- Fault-tolerant design patterns (for example, retries with exponential
backoff and jitter, dead-letter queues)
- Differences between synchronous and asynchronous patterns

Skills in:
- Creating fault-tolerant and resilient applications in a programming
language (for example, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go)
- Creating, extending, and maintaining APIs (for example, response/request
transformations, enforcing validation rules, overriding status codes)
- Writing and running unit tests in development environments (for example,
using AWS Serverless Application Model [AWS SAM])
- Writing code to use messaging services
- Writing code that interacts with AWS services by using APIs and AWS SDKs
- Handling data streaming by using AWS services
